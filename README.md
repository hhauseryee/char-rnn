# char-rnn
A project that sought to develop a character-level RNN that is capable of producing sentences in the style of the German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. The base model and structure was taken from an old PyTorch tutorial on building a character-level RNN that generates Shakespearean prose. Additions were made to the base structure to test the effect of different model architectures and hyperparameters, including various types of RNN cells, weight initializers, and weight activations.
